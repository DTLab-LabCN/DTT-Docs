# Introduction to mDL testing with DTT

With this experimental test suite, you can test your mDL mobile app by performing a data retrieval from Chrome over BLE (18013-5).
Note: the test launches in a new tab, and the test results are not currently integrated with the rest of DTT.

If you want to know more about this test suite, please go and check out the [public repo for this mDL Test suite](https://github.com/DTLab-LabCN/DTT-mDL-Testing).

If you want to learn more about the Web Bluetooth API used by this test suite, take a look at [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/bluetooth](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/bluetooth).
