# Introduction to API endpoint testing with DTT {#introduction-to-api-endpoint-testing-with-dtt}

This is an experimental test suite, which currently requires manual configuration work to enable additional endpoints (by ingesting and customizing its API specification). The goal is to focus on core VC exchange and management features such as *issue*, *verify*, and *revoke*, and to help you understand the interoperability capabilities of a specific endpoint by analyzing the interactions between this test suite and that endpoint.

This test suite is meant to be used in combination with other test suites offered in DTT. For example, this can be used to issue a new Verifiable Credential and use that as an input for the W3C VC test suite to check its adherence to the data model specification.
