**Digital Trust Test Bench (DTT)** is a cloud-based, quality assurance tool for digital credential solutions. It provides  turnkey tools for digital credential industry players and government partners to test out their technology and confirm it works with one another. This testing is a key component to scaling digital credentials across the country (and the world) with the goal of making them ubiquitous.

DTT is not: a certification or compliance tool.
