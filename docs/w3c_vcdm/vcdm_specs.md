# Standards and specifications for the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model

The W3C [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) specification was published as a recommendation in March of 2022, while the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) specification was first published as a Candidate Recommendation Draft in 2024. There are various clarifications and updates worth noting, such as the way validity and expiration dates are handled. Happy exploring with DTT!
