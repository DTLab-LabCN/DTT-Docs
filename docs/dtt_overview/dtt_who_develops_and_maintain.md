# Who develops and maintains DTT?

DTLab and its technical partners develop, host, and maintain DTT.

**_Note_**: DTLab was awarded a 12-month (2024/2025) testing stream contract to test its Digital Trust Test Bench (DTT) with Shared Services Canada and Canadian Digital Service. The contract follows DTLab’s qualification under [Innovative Solutions Canada’s](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/innovative-solutions-canada/) (ISC) “Digitization and Cybersecurity” call for prototypes of platforms.

The program is designed to provide testing and government feedback to organizations that are preparing innovations to go to market. DTLab qualified under the ISC outcome focused on digital credential testing for technical conformity and/or compatibility.
