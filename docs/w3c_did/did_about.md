# About the W3C DID test suite

Based on the [W3C DID Core recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and the [DID Resolution specification draft](https://w3c.github.io/did-resolution/) published by the [Credential Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/credentials), the [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/) (DIF) and its [Identifiers & Discovery Working Group](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/) have produced a DID Universal Resolver. See [https://dev.uniresolver.io/](https://dev.uniresolver.io/) for a DIF-hosted instance of the Universal Resolver that can be used for testing purposes.

## DTT use of godiddy

[**godiddy.com**](https://godiddy.com/app/resolve) provides another implementation of the DID universal resolver, with both free and enterprise tier subscription options (adapted to production use). DTLab, through its partnership with [Danube Tech GmbH](https://danubetech.com/), leverages godiddy to facilitate DID resolution and DID document validation for DTT users.
More information on the godiddy resolver service can be found [here](https://docs.godiddy.com/apis/universal-resolver).
