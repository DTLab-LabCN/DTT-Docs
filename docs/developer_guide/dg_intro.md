# Introduction to the DTT backend API

DTT was conceived to have a separate frontend and backend from the beginning. This enables us to make the test suites accessible through API calls and not just through the DTT frontend, opening up additional possibilities to embed and leverage those testing capabilities.

The DTT API server's public Swagger access is here: [https://api.dtt.dtlab-labcn.app](https://api.dtt.dtlab-labcn.app)
